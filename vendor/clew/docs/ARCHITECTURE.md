# Clew Architecture

Contributor-facing technical overview. For the end-user intro see [README.md](../README.md).

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++23 (concepts, C++20 coroutines for relay, `using enum`, fold expressions)
- **Build**: CMake + vcpkg
- **Core deps**: WinDivert (kernel traffic intercept), WebView2 (embedded browser UI)
- **Backend libs** (vcpkg): `quill` (logging), `nlohmann-json`, `cpp-httplib`, `asio` (standalone)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + shadcn-vue (reka-ui) + Tailwind CSS 4 + AG Grid + Monaco (JSON-only, lazy-loaded)
- **IPC**: HTTP API for CRUD + WebView2 in-process PostMessage for backend → frontend push (replaces the previous SSE channel)
- **Config**: JSON (`clew.json`)
- **Target**: Windows 10 2004+ / 11 (requires `SetInterfaceDnsSettings`), administrator privileges

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized as a four-layer architecture: **domain** → **application services** → **transport**, with a **projection** layer materializing strand state for HTTP responders and the WebView2 push channel. `clew::app` (`src/app.{hpp,cpp}`) is the single owner of the runtime object graph; `main.cpp` is the thin entry adapter (parse args, RAII guards for single-instance / debug console / Winsock, then construct + run the app).

```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Core runtime: single io_context + strand

- One `asio::io_context` with configurable worker threads (`io_threads`, default `hardware_concurrency() / 2`)
- One shared `strand` serializes all process tree + rule engine mutations (zero mutex in hot path)
- ETW events, process start/stop, rule changes all dispatched through the strand

### Process tree: ETW + NtQuery snapshot + Flat Tree

- Real-time ETW `ProcessStart` / `ProcessStop` instead of polling
- `ntquery_snapshot` provides the initial full tree; ETW maintains it incrementally
- `process_tree_manager` orchestrates: ETW + NtQuery + Flat Tree + Rule Engine

### Flat Tree with LC-RS (Left-Child Right-Sibling)

- `flat_tree.hpp`: `std::vector<process_entry>` + `std::unordered_map<DWORD, uint32_t>` side map
- Each entry stores `{pid, parent_pid, create_time, name_u8[780], parent_index, first_child_index, next_sibling_index, flags, group_id, cmdline_cache}`
- O(1) lookup by PID via side map, O(subtree) traversal via LC-RS indices
- `flags` field stores hijack state directly on the entry (no separate map)
- `group_id` field stores proxy group assignment (read by SOCKET layer in hot path)
- Tombstone + compact: dead entries marked, auto-compacted when tombstones > 20% alive

### Backend → frontend push: WebView2 PostMessage

Replaces the earlier SSE / `EventSource` channel. Push events flow:

1. A domain mutation (ETW process start/stop, manual hijack, rule reload) calls
   `process_tree_manager::notify_tree_changed(urgency)` on the strand.
2. `process_projection::on_tree_changed` rebuilds the atomic snapshot and
   pushes immediately (default build). The `push_urgency` hint distinguishes
   user actions (`immediate`) from background ETW (`batched`); see "Coalescing"
   below for the optional compile-time switch.
3. Projection calls `frontend_push_sink::push("process_update", json)`.
4. `webview_app::push` allocates a `push_payload` and posts a custom
   `WM_PUSH_TO_FRONTEND` to the UI thread, so cross-thread marshalling is
   explicit across HTTP workers, ETW threads, and the strand.
5. The UI-thread WndProc takes ownership, builds `{event, data}`, and calls
   `ICoreWebView2::PostWebMessageAsJson`.
6. Frontend's `notify.ts` listens on `chrome.webview` `message` events and
   updates the shared Vue refs (`tree`, etc.); components consume them
   directly.
7. Initial sync: when the frontend mounts (or when visibility transitions
   from hidden back to visible) it posts `{type: 'ready'}` back through
   `chrome.webview.postMessage`. The host invokes
   `process_projection::replay_to_frontend` to re-push the latest snapshot.

Why this transport:

- **In-process IPC**: no HTTP socket, no chunked SSE byte stream — V8's main
  thread is no longer busy parsing the push channel while it is also rendering.
- **No browser connection-limit interference**: HTTP/1.1 caps per-host
  connections (Chromium's default is 6); a long-lived SSE stream permanently
  occupied one of those slots, so bursts of concurrent CRUD calls had one
  fewer slot available. In-process IPC is independent of that pool entirely.
- **Simpler shutdown**: a single window message in flight at most, no
  long-lived HTTP connection to drain.

`/api/processes` (the snapshot endpoint that frontends used to poll) was
removed because the snapshot now arrives inside every `process_update` push;
nothing on the frontend needs to fetch the full tree any more. `/api/processes/:pid`
and `/api/processes/:pid/detail` are kept because they answer single-record
questions that the push channel does not duplicate.

#### Coalescing — compile switch `CLEW_PROJECTION_COALESCE`, ON since v0.10

A 100 ms refresh-coalesce window for `batched` urgency: the refresh happens
**inside** the timer callback, not per event, so a burst of hundreds of ETW
events collapses to a single refresh + push at the end of the window.
`immediate` urgency (user-driven: hijack, rules, exclusions) bypasses the
timer regardless. Since v0.10 **all** ETW-driven changes are `batched`,
including `etw_start` (it used to be `immediate`).

Why it is no longer optional: with SYN parking, CONNECT decisions run on the
same strand, and a decision that waits more than the parking watchdog (20 ms)
lets a connection go direct. ETW delivers a spawn loop's starts and stops
1–2 s later as one burst; measured, that burst of per-event refreshes
(~0.8 ms each for ~450 processes) held a decision past the watchdog once in
100 fresh connections. The trade-off — a new process shows up in the tree
up to 100 ms later — is not perceptible. The option is kept for
experiments (`cmake -DCLEW_PROJECTION_COALESCE=OFF`) but `CMakePresets.json`
pins it ON; an old `build/` cache keeps whatever it had, so reconfigure via
the preset. For characterisation use `tests/stress_etw.py` +
`tests/stress_backend.py` (see the "Build notes" section).

### Visibility gate — minimize / tray drops backend work

When the WebView2 host is hidden (window minimized or in the tray), the
backend stops doing tree-snapshot work entirely. Implementation:

1. `webview_app::set_visible(bool)` is the single chokepoint. It's called
   from `WM_SIZE` (SIZE_MINIMIZED → false, SIZE_RESTORED / SIZE_MAXIMIZED →
   true), `on_close` close-to-tray (false), and `restore_window` (true).
   It toggles `ICoreWebView2Controller::IsVisible` (so `document.visibilityState`
   in the embedded page tracks reality) and fires a registered
   `on_visibility_change_` callback. Idempotent — repeated calls with the
   same state are no-ops, which matters for `WM_SIZE` chatter.
2. `app::wire_observers` wires the callback to
   `process_projection::set_frontend_visible(bool)`, which stores into a
   `std::atomic<bool> frontend_visible_` (relaxed memory order — this is
   a hint, not a strict barrier).
3. `process_projection::on_tree_changed` checks the flag at the very top
   and early-returns when hidden. No `refresh_snapshot`, no PostMessage,
   no V8 wake-up. The strand is free to serve other work (in practice
   there's nothing else to serve while the user has the window away).
4. The frontend `useDocumentVisibility` composable mirrors the gate on the
   client side: the three remaining polled endpoints (`/api/stats`,
   `/api/tcp`, `/api/udp` via `fetchActivity` / `fetchConnections` /
   `fetchStatus`) suspend their `setInterval` while hidden.
5. When the host returns to visible, `set_visible(true)` does NOT replay
   automatically — instead, the frontend's `visibilitychange` handler
   re-posts `{type: 'ready'}`, which drives the existing replay path
   (`process_projection::replay_to_frontend`). The frontend gets a full
   fresh snapshot in one shot.

Net effect (measured under sustained 270 ETW events/sec at tree=1200):
strand utilisation 48% visible → 0.0% hidden, hijack wait_us tail 940 ms →
92 µs (any user CRUD waiting in the queue still completes; just nothing
new piling up). See `memory/MEMORY.md` for the v0.8.9 release notes.

### Autostart on logon (Task Scheduler, v0.9.0)

Settings → "Start Clew at logon" registers a Windows Task Scheduler entry that launches clew.exe at user login with the user's elevated token. The naive registry approach (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) would prompt UAC every login, since clew.exe needs admin for WinDivert and `SetInterfaceDnsSettings`. Task Scheduler with `/RL HIGHEST` skips the prompt.

- **`src/services/autostart_service.{hpp,cpp}`** — stateless static API (`query()` / `set(enabled, start_minimized)`). Implementation shells out to `schtasks.exe` (system32 absolute path, not PATH-dependent), captures stdout + stderr via anonymous pipes drained by `std::jthread`s in parallel (a single sequential drain deadlocks if schtasks writes more to stderr than the buffer holds). Command-line construction goes through a `quote_win_arg` helper that follows the `CommandLineToArgvW` rules so paths with spaces or quotes survive. State lives in the OS, not in `clew.json` — `query()` shells out fresh on every call so manual edits via `taskschd.msc` are reflected immediately in the UI.
- **`src/transport/handlers/autostart_handlers.cpp`** — `GET /api/autostart` returns `{enabled, start_minimized}`; `PUT /api/autostart` writes through to `autostart_service::set` and re-queries. No `api_context` dependency (mirrors `shell_service`).
- **`webview_app::start_minimized_`** — when set (via `--minimized` CLI arg or `app::create_gui` from `cli_options`), the host window goes through `SW_HIDE` instead of `SW_SHOW` (cleaner than `SW_MINIMIZE` — no taskbar flash). Once the WebView2 controller is created (asynchronously, in a callback), `IsVisible` is set to `FALSE` so `process_projection`'s `frontend_visible` gate (Visibility gate above) matches reality from `t=0` and no work piles up.
- **Task command line**: `"<exe-abs-path>" --config "<exe-dir>/clew.json"` plus `--minimized` if the sub-toggle is on. `--config` is pinned even though `exe_directory() / "clew.json"` is the default — explicit pinning self-documents the autostart contract in the task entry.

### Frontend HTTP CRUD: empty `body: ''` on DELETE

This is independent of the push-transport switch above — they were two
separate problems that happened to ship in the same release.

cpp-httplib (as of v0.31, the version pinned by vcpkg) treats DELETE the same
as POST/PUT/PATCH: `expect_content()` returns true and the server's
`read_content_core` enters an `MSG_PEEK` block whenever the request has neither
`Content-Length` nor chunked `Transfer-Encoding`. With the default 100 MB
`payload_max_length` and 5 s `read_timeout_sec`, that peek waits the full
read timeout before the handler is even dispatched — even if the handler
reads no body. Browser `fetch` DELETE without an explicit body sends no
`Content-Length`, so an Unhack click stalled for ~5 s server-side before any
of our code ran.

The fix is on the client side. `frontend/src/api/client.ts` always passes
`body: ''` for DELETE-shaped CRUD calls (`unhijackProcess`, `deleteAutoRule`,
`unexcludePid`, `deleteProxyGroup`). The browser then emits
`Content-Length: 0`, cpp-httplib takes the fast path in `read_content` (length
0 → return immediately), and the handler runs in <2 ms. The server-side
alternative (`set_payload_max_length(SIZE_MAX)`) was avoided because it opens
the server to unbounded payload allocations; a one-line client change is the
proportional fix. See `memory/lesson_cpp_httplib_delete_5s.md` for the full
diagnosis trail.

### WinDivert dual-layer

- **SOCKET SNIFF layer** (`windivert_socket.hpp`): observes `connect()` and `close()` events (filter `outbound and !loopback and tcp and (event == CONNECT or event == CLOSE)`). For every CONNECT it publishes exactly one decision into `PortTracker[local_port]`: `proxied(group)` or `direct`. Unknown PIDs (younger than the ~1–2 s ETW delivery) are resolved on the spot by `process_tree_manager::resolve_pid_now` (ancestor walk + insert with the real PSN, so the late ETW START is an idempotent no-op). Handler runs on the strand.
- **NETWORK reflection layer** (`windivert_network.hpp`): filter `outbound and tcp and !loopback`, opened with `flags = 0` — WinDivert's divert mode, so every matched packet is held until we `WinDivertSend` it. Reads `PortTracker[src_port]`. `proxied` → `swap(SrcAddr,DstAddr)` + `DstPort = redirect_port` + `Outbound = 0` (inbound reinject, streamdump pattern). Initial SYNs without a decision are **parked** (next section). Two dedicated blocking worker threads.
- WinDivert's layer split is the reason for both layers: NETWORK can block/inject but has no PID; SOCKET has the PID but cannot touch packets. The local port is the only key they share.

### TCP SYN parking (v0.10)

Why: the kernel emits the SOCKET CONNECT event *before* the SYN (0 violations in 58, lead p50 17.6 µs), but our SOCKET and NETWORK pipelines are two independent async paths of comparable latency. Before parking, the NETWORK worker released a SYN whose port had no decision yet — which for a freshly spawned process (git, curl, gh: connect ~150 ms after birth, ETW announces it 1–2 s later) was *every* first connection. Measured interception rate for fresh `git ls-remote`: **0/30**. Design record: memory `project/syn_parking/`; PoC + numbers: `win_prox/tools/poc/poc_syn_parking_report.md`.

How:

1. NETWORK worker sees an outbound `SYN && !ACK` whose slot has no usable decision → copies packet + `WINDIVERT_ADDRESS` into a bounded pool (`syn_parker.hpp`, 256 × 2 KB) and CASes the slot `empty → pending(gen, idx)`. The worker keeps receiving; nothing blocks.
2. SOCKET handler (strand) decides and calls `PortTracker::publish`. If the slot is `pending`, the CAS `pending → proxied|direct` transfers ownership of the pool index to the strand, which hands it to the **injector thread**.
3. Injector copies the packet out, frees the pool slot, then sends: verbatim for `direct`, reflected for `proxied`. (`WinDivertSend` is 47–190 µs; the strand only publishes.)
4. **Watchdog**: the injector wakes every 1 ms (`CreateWaitableTimerEx` + `CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION`; a plain 1 ms wait is quantised to the 15.6 ms tick) and releases anything parked longer than `watchdog_ms` (20, cap 50) unchanged, pinning the port `abandoned` with the SYN's kernel timestamp. A decision that arrives later for that flow is **rejected** (`late_rejected`) rather than applied mid-flow — reflecting an established direct connection is exactly the breakage this removes. Normal park times are < 1 ms; 4.7 ms was the worst seen under a 300-connection burst with zero watchdog fires.

Rules that keep it correct (numbers are the design-record item ids):

- **Four states** `empty / pending / proxied / direct / abandoned` packed as `{state:8 | gen:24 | idx:32}` in one atomic word; every transition is a CAS, the CAS winner owns the pool index (17, 18, 22). Strand does all publishes and clears; workers only `empty → pending`; the watchdog only `pending → abandoned`.
- **Kernel-timestamp TTL** (21): a SYN acts on a slot's decision only if `SYN.Timestamp − slot.connect_ts ≤ 10 ms` (same QPC clock at both layers); older is treated as empty and parks. One exception: the worker records the ISN of each SYN it handles, and a later SYN with the **same ISN** on the same port is that connection retransmitting (RTO ≥ 1 s, so always past the TTL) — it acts on the held state at once (`retransmit_passed`) instead of parking for T and inflating `released_by_watchdog`. A different ISN on the same port is a new connection and takes the park path; Windows randomises the ISN per connection, so the exception cannot swallow a real new flow.
- **Every CONNECT publishes** (2): resolve failure, not-proxied, CIDR-excluded all publish `direct`. So `pending` has one cause: the event never arrived.
- **Phantom CONNECT** (24): each re-injected SYN produces a second CONNECT for the same flow (`ProcessId = 4`, ~60–880 µs later). `PortTracker::is_echo` (same remote, decision younger than the TTL) drops it before any tree lookup.
- **CLOSE fires at `closesocket()`** (25), before the wire is done. CLOSE clears `direct` / `abandoned` / `pending` (parked SYN dropped, pool slot returned); `proxied` slots are cleared only by relay teardown, which posts `clear_if(port, connect_ts)` to the strand (23) — an unconditional off-strand clear could wipe a newer flow that reused the port after a passive close.
- **Never proxy self** (10): the SOCKET filter no longer excludes our PID (an unobserved self connection would park for the whole watchdog); instead `windivert_socket::decide` returns `direct` for `GetCurrentProcessId()` before consulting any rule, so `*.exe`-style rules cannot loop upstream connections. Only matters for non-loopback proxies — with a `127.0.0.1` proxy `!loopback` already keeps self out.
- **Pool full → pass + pin** (8), never evict; a duplicate SYN while `pending` is dropped without allocating (19). The leak signal is `pool_in_use` not returning to 0 between bursts (12).
- **Kill switch** `tcp_syn_parking.enabled = false` (14): no pool, no injector thread, no synchronous PID resolve, SOCKET publishes only `proxied`, NETWORK passes every undecided SYN — the pre-v0.10 code paths, for when the new code itself is what broke. Resolve and parking are a pair: resolve without parking publishes the decision ~100 µs after the SYN left, mid-flow, and the NETWORK layer then reflects an established direct connection (measured: 20/20 TLS timeouts). Startup-only; logged as `[SYN-PARK] enabled/disabled`.
- **PID recycling at connect time**: ETW STOP is delivered as late as START, so a spawn loop hands a new process a PID whose dead predecessor is still in the tree (seen 1 in 30). `resolve_pid_now` therefore verifies every known PID against the live PSN (one `OpenProcess` + `NtQueryInformationProcess`, ~10–30 µs) and re-resolves on mismatch; the insert tombstones the stale entry and the late STOP becomes a no-op.
- **UDP is unchanged** (11): per-packet policy table since v0.9.5; the BIND/CONNECT → first datagram lead is 5–10× TCP's and a miss costs one datagram.
- Build: `CLEW_PROJECTION_COALESCE` is now ON (option default + `CMakePresets.json`). `resolve_pid_now` triggers a tree change on the strand; without coalescing that is an immediate full refresh + ~35 KB serialize, which would hold the next CONNECT decisions past the watchdog. If you reuse an old `build/` cache, reconfigure via the preset.

Counters (`GET /api/stats` → `tcp_syn_parking`, and a `[SYN-PARK]` INFO line every 60 s when they change): `parking.released_by_watchdog` and `socket.late_rejected_proxied` are the two that mean "proxy missed a flow"; `parking.pool_in_use` must drop back to 0; `gen_mismatch`, `oversize`, `send_failures` must stay 0.

### PortTracker

- `std::array<TrackerSlot, 65536>`, each slot one 64-byte line: `atomic<uint64_t> word` (state / generation / pool index) + `connect_ts` (kernel timestamp of the CONNECT) + `pinned_ts` (kernel timestamp of the SYN the watchdog released) + `TrackerEntry{remote_addr, remote_port, group_id}` (~4 MB heap)
- `alignas(64)` per slot to avoid false sharing; `TrackerEntry` must stay trivially copyable (static_assert — PR #1's shared_ptr-in-slot was UB)
- Auxiliary fields are written before the release-CAS and read after an acquire load; each state reads only its own aux fields, so a writer that loses its CAS clobbers nothing that matters
- `proxied` entries persist for the connection lifetime and are cleared by the relay via `clear_if` on the strand; `direct` / `abandoned` by the SOCKET CLOSE event; the TTL covers whatever both miss

### C++20 coroutine relay

- `acceptor.hpp`: Asio TCP acceptor spawns `relay_session` coroutine per connection
- `relay.hpp`: bidirectional async pipe using `asio::co_spawn` + `async_read_some` / `async_write`
- `socks5_async.hpp`: SOCKS5 handshake as a coroutine (no blocking threads)

### Rule priority

1. **Manual rule** (PID exact match, sets `flags | MANUAL` on flat_tree entry) — highest
2. **Auto rule** (process name / cmdline match, config order) — sets `group_id`
3. **Default**: DIRECT (`group_id = 0`, no flags)

### Auto rule matching

- **`process_name`**: glob match (`*` any sequence, `?` single char, case-insensitive). Examples: `python.exe`, `curl*`
- **`cmdline_pattern`**: two modes, auto-selected by pattern content:
  - **Keyword mode** (no `*` or `?`): space-separated fragments, ALL must appear as case-insensitive substrings, order-independent. `udp_client` matches `python.exe udp_client.py --port 8080`; `udp_client 8080` also matches; `udp_client 9090` does not.
  - **Glob mode** (contains `*` or `?`): full wildcard match against the entire cmdline, order-sensitive. `*udp_client*8080*` matches; `*8080*udp_client*` does not.
- **Lazy cmdline query**: `cmdline` is fetched via `NtQueryInformationProcess` only when a rule has `cmdline_pattern` set AND `process_name` already matched. Cached in `process_entry.cmdline_cache` (sentinel `\x01` = queried but failed/empty). Zero overhead when no rule uses cmdline.

### Process tree logic for auto rules (hack_tree pinned true since v0.9.0)

Find matching process → traverse to tree root (parent not matching same name) → set flags on root and all LC-RS descendants (including dynamically created children via ETW ProcessStart).

Since v0.9.0 the UI exposes only **Hack** and **Unhack** (no separate "Unhack Tree"); both operate in tree mode. The `AutoRule.hack_tree` field is preserved on disk for forward compatibility but `rule_engine_v3::set_auto_rules` pins it to `true` at load time, so a per-rule single-node mode does not exist at runtime. To spare a single descendant the user clicks Unhack on that specific node — clearing manual flags off a subtree leaves siblings unaffected.

The HTTP handler `process_handlers.cpp::handle_hijack` / `handle_unhijack` no longer reads the `tree` body/query parameter; the `process_tree_service` signature still takes `tree_mode` so a future per-rule exclude can plug in.

### PID recycling handling

- Windows recycles PIDs, and ETW delivers `ProcessStop` 1–2 s late (same as `ProcessStart`). Inside that window a new process can carry a PID whose dead owner is still in the tree. A tight spawn loop hits this routinely (measured: 1 in 30 fresh curls, 14 in 200 under a 1000-process storm).
- The tree's identity is `(pid, psn)` (`ProcessSequenceNumber`, boot-unique): `find_by_pid_psn` for ETW STOP and idempotent START; `add_entry` with a known PID and a different PSN tombstones the old entry first. The hot-path `find_by_pid` (SOCKET handlers) returns the latest owner, so `resolve_pid_now` verifies a known PID against the live PSN before trusting it.
- **Rule for any state keyed by a bare PID** (added after the second recycled-PID bug, 2026-09-07): it must say how it survives a recycled PID — either key it by `(pid, psn)` / PSN, or reset it on both owner-change hooks: `process_tree_manager::handle_stop` (ETW STOP) *and* the overwrite path in `handle_start_or_rundown` (a different-PSN insert over an existing PID; reached from ETW START and from the synchronous resolve). Today's bare-PID state: `AutoRule::matched_pids` / `excluded_pids` — reset via `rule_engine_v3::on_process_exit` on both hooks. Known residual: tree inheritance tests `matched_pids.contains(parent_pid)`, so a parent PID recycled inside the window lets an unrelated new process's children inherit the rule until the STOP lands; the systematic fix is PSN-keyed rule state (see the deferred list in the project notes).
- PortTracker slots are not cleaned by ETW at all: `proxied` slots by relay teardown, `direct` / `abandoned` by SOCKET CLOSE, and the kernel-timestamp TTL covers what both miss (see "TCP SYN parking").
- Flat-tree LC-RS pointers are updated on tombstone; children are reparented to the nearest alive ancestor.

### Multi-proxy routing via proxy groups

- `ProxyGroup`: named proxy config with auto-increment `uint32_t id` (0 = default group)
- `AutoRule.proxy_group_id` references a group
- Relay coroutine reads group config from a shared map to determine SOCKS5 target

### UDP interception (mirrors TCP, per-port sessions)

- Same dual-layer architecture as TCP: `windivert_socket_udp` + `windivert_network_udp`
- Each app-level UDP port gets its own SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE session (RFC 1928)
- Response routing via per-port session table — no cross-process bleed
- `UdpTrackerEntry` is `{group_id, pid, policy_id}` — trivially copyable, `policy_id` indexes the published `PolicyTable`
- Dst excludes: a `connect()`ed socket has one fixed destination, so the exclude is decided once on the strand at CONNECT (excluded → no tracker entry, direct). A bind-then-`sendto` socket (e.g. a DNS client) hits many destinations, so its packets are evaluated per-packet in the NETWORK worker via a `PolicyReader` (one generation compare per packet).
- The SOCKS5 UDP data socket binds the wildcard address (to reach a remote relay), so downstream drops any datagram whose sender is not the relay endpoint.
- See `src/udp/` for all UDP-specific files

### DNS proxy (optional, off by default)

- User enables via Settings → DNS Proxy toggle
- **Forwarder mode** (only mode implemented): `dns_forwarder` listens UDP on `127.0.0.2:53`, forwards queries to upstream (default `8.8.8.8:53`) via SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE using the first proxy group's endpoint
- `DnsManager` (src/core/dns_manager.hpp) orchestrates:
  - **System DNS auto-config**: on enable, saves original DNS per active IPv4 interface to `dns_state.json`, points interfaces to `127.0.0.2` via `SetInterfaceDnsSettings`
  - **Hot-reload**: Settings UI changes trigger `apply()`, which diffs new vs current config and starts / stops / restarts forwarder + updates system DNS accordingly, no restart required
  - **Crash recovery**: on startup, if `dns_state.json` exists it means the previous session exited abnormally — restore system DNS from file, then delete it
- Limitation: forwarder is UDP-only. Chromium TCP:53 fallback is not handled (not needed in practice when UDP works).

The engine is always-on while `clew.exe` runs — there is no start/stop control plane. WinDivert layers + acceptor + UDP relay + DNS manager are initialized at startup and torn down on shutdown.

Push events (delivered via `WM_PUSH_TO_FRONTEND` → `PostWebMessageAsJson`,
*not* over HTTP — see "Backend → frontend push" above):
- `process_update` — full process-tree snapshot, after the projection's
  100 ms coalesce window
- `auto_rule_changed` — `{action: string}`; tells the frontend to refetch
  rules-related state

## Build

- **Configure**: `cmake --preset windows-vcpkg` (uses `CMakePresets.json`)
- **Build Release**: `cmake --build build --config Release`
- **Build Debug**: `cmake --build build --config Debug`
- **Run** (admin required): `.\build\Release\clew.exe`
- **Frontend dev**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- **Frontend build**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Opt-in: refresh-coalesce window** (perf experimentation only, default OFF):
  `cmake -DCLEW_PROJECTION_COALESCE=ON build` then rebuild. Enables a 100 ms
  refresh-coalesce timer for `batched` urgency events (see "Coalescing" in
  Key Architectural Decisions).

### Resource path resolution (v0.9.0)

Earlier versions resolved `clew.log`, `clew.json`, `dns_state.json`, and `frontend/dist` against the launching shell's cwd, which silently broke when running under Task Scheduler (cwd = `system32`), via shortcut, or from a parent directory. v0.9.0 makes resolution explicit and cwd-independent:

- **`src/core/exe_paths.hpp`** — small header exposing `exe_path()` / `exe_directory()` / `exe_relative(name)`. All four resources go through these.
- **`clew.log`** — written to `exe_directory() / "clew.log"` (set in `main.cpp::setup_logger`).
- **`clew.json`** — `--config <path>` if explicitly passed, otherwise `exe_directory() / "clew.json"`. Wired in `app::app(...)` ctor's initializer list.
- **`dns_state.json`** — `dns_manager` constructor receives `exe_relative("dns_state.json")` from `app::app`.
- **`frontend/dist`** — `http_api_server::setup_static_files` candidate list anchors to `get_executable_dir()` (release zip layout: `<exe>/frontend/dist`; dev build layout: `<exe>/../../frontend/dist`); cwd-relative candidates were removed.

One deliberate exception (v0.9.6): the **WebView2 user data folder** — pure browser cache, not configuration — lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\clew\webview_data` (`exe_paths.hpp::local_app_data_directory`, falling back to the old exe-relative `clew_webview_data` only if `%LOCALAPPDATA%` cannot be resolved). It cannot be exe-relative: when the app is installed under `Program Files`, WebView2's sandboxed child processes cannot use a user data folder inside the install directory and controller creation fails with `0x800700aa` (issue #5, reproduced and variable-isolated 2026-08-31).

The autostart Task Scheduler entry pins `--config <abs path>` explicitly so a system32-cwd launch still finds the user's config. `--minimized` is also part of the registered command line when "Start minimized to tray" is on.

## Build notes

- WinDivert + `SetInterfaceDnsSettings` both require administrator privileges. The UAC manifest is embedded via linker `/MANIFESTUAC:level='requireAdministrator'` (see `CMakeLists.txt`) — double-click triggers UAC prompt automatically.
- ~30 translation units after the three-layer refactor (was a single TU in the legacy header-only layout). `CMakeLists.txt` enables `/MP` for parallel compilation; first clean build is noticeably longer than the legacy version, incremental builds are fine.
- Frontend builds to static files served by cpp-httplib at runtime; dev mode uses Vite's proxy to port 18080.
- Kill `clew.exe` before rebuilding (MSVC LNK1104 error otherwise).
- `bash scripts/verify.sh` runs frontend build + cpp build + 7 layering grep guards + the HTTP e2e suite (`run_all.py`) + the Playwright + WebView2 e2e suite (`run_pw.py`) as a single command, each stage wrapped with a per-stage `timeout` so a single hung step aborts cleanly. Requires an administrator shell (clew.exe needs elevation), `npm` for the frontend build, and `uv` for the PEP 723 inline-deps Playwright runner.

### E2E testing strategy: log-scan over Playwright timing

The HTTP e2e suite runs 22 cases against a live clew.exe; the Playwright suite runs 3. The split is deliberate:

- **Traffic interception is judged by the exit IP, never by counters.** The suite copies `System32\curl.exe` to a private name (`clew_e2e_curl.exe`) so its rule cannot collide with the user's own `curl.exe` rule, measures two references once per run (through `--proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:7890`, and direct with `trust_env=False`), and refuses to run when the two are equal, because the proxy would then be routing the target DIRECT. Then 20 sequential and 20 concurrent fresh probe processes must all report the proxy's exit IP, and a control case with the rule disabled must report the direct IP. `tcp_syn_parking` deltas (`proxied_decisions`, `released_by_watchdog`, `late_rejected`, `pool_in_use`) are secondary evidence: a wrong decision published on time leaves every counter quiet (see "TCP SYN parking").
- **HTTP / log-scan** (`tests/e2e_api_test.py`) — anything assertable from `clew.log` lives here. T22 (batch_hijack single notify, was T14) counts `[tree-change] source=batch_hijack` lines in a measurement window; T23 (DELETE 60ms regression net for the cpp-httplib bug) reads the server-side elapsed time from the `[api] DELETE … (Xus)` line. Both are independent of the frontend's own timing — V8 contention can't make these tests flaky. The suite flips `log_level=debug` at startup and restores on exit (`try/finally`), so DEBUG lines like `[tree-change]` are visible inside the run without polluting default behaviour.
- **Playwright** (`tests/playwright_e2e/run_pw.py`) — only UI-side regressions that pure HTTP can't observe: no `/api/events` fetch ever made (no SSE leak), backend push reaches the Vue tree, no HTTP polling under ETW load. **Removed**: T14 batch single-push (replaced by T22 log-scan), DELETE 60ms (replaced by T23 log-scan), stress UI responsiveness (Playwright `page.evaluate` competes with V8 main-thread push processing, RTTs measured through CDP are several times higher than actual backend latency — wrong tool for that question).

To enable the log-scan tests, the underlying instrumentation went in v0.9.0:
- `notify_tree_changed` logs `[tree-change] source=…` at DEBUG (zero cost at default `info` level).
- `route_registry::dispatch` was already logging `[api] METHOD path -> status (Xus)` at INFO; v0.9.0 added `write_json` setting `res.status=200` explicitly so the recorded status is the real value (was `-1`, cpp-httplib's pre-flush sentinel).

### Performance harness (no Playwright)

For perf characterisation independent of the Playwright runner (which itself
competes with V8 main-thread push processing under load):

- `tests/stress_etw.py` — PEP 723 ETW churn driver. Maintains a target
  population of short-lived `cmd.exe /c ping ...` children so Windows
  continuously fires ProcessStart / ProcessStop events. Each child = 2 OS
  processes (cmd + ping) so `--target N` produces ~2N stress processes plus
  ambient. Knobs: `--target / --min-life / --max-life / --duration`.
- `tests/stress_backend.py` — pure-Python perf measurement. Spawns
  stress_etw, exercises hijack via HTTP at a configurable cadence, scans
  `clew.log` for instrumentation traces in the measured wall-clock window,
  reports per-stage timing distributions (refresh_us / push_us / strand
  wait_us / hijack RTT). Optional `--visibility-cycle` to drive minimize
  / restore mid-test via `WM_SYSCOMMAND` and bucket pre / hidden / post
  metrics — useful for verifying the visibility gate.

Neither harness is part of `verify.sh` (they're for ad-hoc characterisation,
not regression).
